2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock and clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock_1 and clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HS relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on VS relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_BRAM_VGA_Clock 
Related violations: <none>
